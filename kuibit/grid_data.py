"""The :py:mod:`~.grid_data` module provides representations of data on
uniform grids as well as for data on refined grid hierarchies. Standard
arithmetic operations are supported for those data grids, further methods
to interpolate and resample. The number of dimensions is arbitrary.

The important classes defined here are
- :py:class:`~.UniformGrid` represents the geometry of a uniform Cartesian
cell-centered grid.
- :py:class:`~.UniformGridData` represents data on a uniform grid.
- :py:class:`~.HierarchicalGridData` represents data on a refined grid
hierarchy (AMR).

A :py:class:`~.UniformGridData` object contains a :py:class:`~.UniformGrid` one.
Similarly, a :py:class:`~.HierarchicalGridData` contains multiple
:py:class:`~.UniformGridData`.

class UniformGrid:
    """Describes the geometry of a regular rectangular dataset, as well as
    information needed to identify the grid if part of refined grid hierarchy
    (namely component number and refinement level). In practice, this a fixed
    refinement level, or part of it (as output by an MPI process).

    This is a standard Cartesian grid that we will describe with the language
    of computer graphics. To make things clear, let's consider a 2D grid (see
    schematics below). We call the lower left corner "origin" or "x0". We call
    the top right corner "x1". The grid is cell-centered (see Fig 2).

    The concept of ``shape`` is the same as NumPy shape: it's the number of points
    in each dimension. ``dx`` is the spacing (dx, dy, dz, ...). To fully
    describe a grid, one needs the ``origin``, the ``shape``, and ``x1`` or ``dx``.

    (This is the same convention that Carpet has.)

    This class is supposed to be immutable.
