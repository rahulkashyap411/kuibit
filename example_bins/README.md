# Example executables build with `kuibit`

In this directory, we collect working programs built with `kuibit`. You can
use these scripts as good examples of ``kuibit``usage (or you can directly use
them).

Scripts available:
- `plot_grid`, plot any 2D grid function on a grid specified via command-line.
- `plot_scalar`, plot any reduction of any variable as a timeseries.
